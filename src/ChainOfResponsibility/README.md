### Purpose
Gives more than one object an opportunity to handle a request
by linking receiving objects together.
### Use When
- Multiple objects may handle a request and the handler
doesn’t have to be a specific object.
- A set of objects should be able to handle a request with the
handler determined at runtime.
- A request not being handled is an acceptable potential
outcome.
### Example
Exception handling in some languages implements this pattern.
When an exception is thrown in a method the runtime checks to
see if the method has a mechanism to handle the exception or
if it should be passed up the call stack. When passed up the call
stack the process repeats until code to handle the exception is
encountered or until there are no more parent objects to hand
the request to.
